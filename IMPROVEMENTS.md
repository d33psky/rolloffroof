# Future Improvements for RollOffRoof Observatory System

This document contains proposed improvements and enhancements for the observatory control system, organized by priority.

## Priority 1: Critical Safety & Operations

### 1. Alert & Notification System 🚨
**Status**: TODO - Currently alert_and_abort() has placeholder (ekos_sentinel.py:369)
**Impact**: Critical for emergency response

**Proposed Implementation**:
- Email/SMS alerts using SMTP/Twilio integration
- Telegram bot for real-time notifications
- Configurable alert levels (info, warning, critical, emergency)
- Alert history logging with timestamps
- Multi-channel redundancy (if email fails, try SMS)
- Template-based messages for different alert types

**Configuration additions**:
```yaml
alerts:
  email:
    enabled: true
    smtp_server: "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port: 587
    username: "observatory@example.com"
    recipients: ["operator@example.com", "backup@example.com"]
  sms:
    enabled: true
    provider: "twilio"
    recipients: ["+1234567890"]
  telegram:
    enabled: true
    bot_token: "xxx"
    chat_ids: ["123456789"]
```

### 2. Scheduler Detection Enhancement 📅
**Status**: TODO - ekos_sentinel.py:484 mentions detecting scheduler vs manual mode
**Impact**: High - Improves safety shutdown decisions

**Proposed Solution**:
- Query D-Bus for KStars scheduler state before emergency actions
- Different wait times for scheduler vs manual operations
- Add scheduler detection to configuration system
- Implement graceful vs immediate shutdown based on mode

**Implementation**:
```python
def detect_operation_mode(self):
    """Detect if scheduler or manual imaging is active"""
    try:
        if self.scheduler_iface is None:
            self.setup_scheduler_iface(verbose=False)
        # Query scheduler status via D-Bus
        scheduler_status = self.scheduler_iface.status()
        return "scheduler" if scheduler_status == "Running" else "manual"
    except:
        return "unknown"
```

### 3. INDI Device Connection Monitoring 🔌
**Status**: TODO - ekos_cli.py:139 uses fixed 5-second sleep
**Impact**: Medium - Improves reliability of device connections

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Poll INDI devices until all are connected
- Configurable timeout with exponential backoff
- Device-specific health checks
- Connection status reporting

**Implementation**:
```python
def wait_for_indi_devices(self, timeout=60, devices=None):
    """Wait for INDI devices to connect with proper polling"""
    start_time = time.time()
    retry_delay = 1
    
    while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
        if self.check_device_connections(devices):
            return True
        time.sleep(retry_delay)
        retry_delay = min(retry_delay * 1.5, 10)  # Exponential backoff
    
    return False
```

## Priority 2: System Reliability

### 4. Weather Service Integration 🌤️
**Status**: weather_safety_service.py is empty
**Impact**: High - External weather data improves safety decisions

**Proposed Additions**:
- OpenWeatherMap/WeatherAPI integration for current conditions
- Cloud coverage prediction and trends
- Severe weather alerts and warnings
- Historical weather data collection for ML predictions
- Backup weather sources for redundancy

**New Service**:
```python
class WeatherService:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.apis = [
            OpenWeatherMapAPI(config.get('weather.openweather.api_key')),
            WeatherAPIService(config.get('weather.weatherapi.api_key'))
        ]
    
    def get_current_conditions(self):
        # Try primary API, fallback to secondary
        pass
    
    def get_forecast(self, hours=12):
        # Get weather forecast for planning
        pass
    
    def check_severe_weather_alerts(self):
        # Check for severe weather warnings
        pass
```

### 5. Unified Configuration Management ⚙️
**Status**: Multiple config files across different components
**Impact**: Medium - Simplifies management and reduces errors

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Merge all configurations (roof, database, INDI, alerts) into unified YAML
- Environment-based configs (development/staging/production)
- Configuration validation using pydantic schemas
- Secrets management separate from config files
- Hot-reloading of non-critical configuration changes

**New Structure**:
```yaml
# observatory_config.yaml
environment: production

database:
  host: "database.domain"
  port: 3306
  credentials_file: "/etc/observatory/db_secrets.yaml"

indi:
  host: "localhost"
  devices: { ... }

roof:
  motor_pins: { ... }
  sensors: { ... }

alerts:
  email: { ... }
  sms: { ... }

weather:
  apis: { ... }
  thresholds: { ... }
```

### 6. Monitoring & Observability 📊
**Status**: Limited logging, no metrics collection
**Impact**: Medium - Essential for debugging and performance monitoring

**Proposed Additions**:
- Prometheus metrics collection for all services
- Grafana dashboards for real-time observatory status
- Health endpoints (`/health`, `/metrics`) for all services
- Distributed tracing to track operations across components
- Log aggregation and structured logging

**Metrics Examples**:
- `roof_operations_total{operation="open|close|stop"}`
- `weather_safety_status{station="1|2|3"}`
- `mount_park_duration_seconds`
- `indi_command_failures_total{device="camera|mount|dome"}`

## Priority 3: Code Quality & Reliability

### 8. Security Enhancements 🔒
**Status**: No authentication on Flask endpoints
**Impact**: Medium - Important for production deployment

**Proposed Additions**:
- API key/JWT authentication for Flask endpoints
- TLS/SSL encryption for all network communications
- Audit logging for all control operations

1. **Start with Priority 1 items** - Focus on safety and operational reliability
2. **Create feature branches** - Use git branches for each improvement
3. **Implement incrementally** - Each improvement should be self-contained
4. **Test thoroughly** - Use simulator configuration for safe testing
5. **Document changes** - Update CLAUDE.md as features are added

Each improvement includes implementation suggestions but should be adapted based on specific observatory requirements and constraints.
